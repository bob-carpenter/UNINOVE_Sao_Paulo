```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE,
                      fig.width = 6,
                      fig.asp = 0.618,
                      out.width = "70%",
                      fig.align = "center",
                      fig.retina = 3)
```

Remembering our labels:

```{r labels}
library(tibble)
library(gt)
tribble(
                        ~code, ~label,
                        "0", "Unrelated tweet",
            "1", "User currently has symptoms",
          "2", "User had symptoms in the past",
    "3", "Someone else currently has symptoms",
  "4", "Someone else had symptoms in the past",
                      "5", "Conspiracy theory",
  "6", "Someone else has died (death related)",
       "99" ,"Indonesian, portugal, spanish etc"
  ) %>%
  gt
```


We have 3 CSV's from 3 different labellers:

* `sample_1k - elias.csv`
* `sample_1k - paula.csv`
* `sample_1k - vini.csv`

Here is the data import and a sample of data without personal data (just `annotator`, `text`, and `label`)

```{r read-data}
library(fs)
library(purrr)
library(vroom)
library(dplyr, warn.conflicts = FALSE)
library(stringr)
files <- dir_ls(here::here("pre-labeling"), regexp = "sample_1k(.*).csv")
df <- files %>% map_dfr(~vroom(.,
                         col_types = "ffTcfccc?ciif",
                         na = c("", "NA", "None"),
                         locale = locale(time_format = "y-m-d H:M:S")),
                        .id = "annotator") %>%
  mutate(annotator = str_extract(annotator, "(\\w*)(?=(\\.csv))"))
df %>%
  select(annotator, text, label) %>%
  head %>%
  gt
```

## Annotator Agreement

Group by `index` since we have 1k different `index`:

```{r index-length}
length(unique(df$index))
```

Then create a agreement rate with `n_distinct` of label. This means that:

* 1 / 1 = 100% agreement
* 1 / 2 = 50% agreement
* 1 / 3 = 33% agreement

We also have multiple labels like `1,4` etc. Also removing empty labels `""` (clearly a mistake) and correcting `999` to `99` (1 occurence, a mistake).

```{r annotator-agree}
library(tidyr)
df_dup <- df %>%
  group_by(index) %>%
  mutate(label = str_squish(as.character(label))) %>%
  mutate(label = str_split(label, ",")) %>%
  unnest(c(label)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(label = str_squish(label)) %>%
  filter(label != "") %>%
  mutate(label = if_else(label == "999", "99", label)) %>%
  mutate(label = as.factor(label))
agreed_df <- df_dup %>%
  group_by(index) %>%
  summarise(agreement = 1 / n_distinct(label))
```

The total of agreement is `r (agreed_df %>% summarize(mean(agreement))) * 100`%.

```{r overall-agree}
agreed_df %>%
  summarize(mean(agreement)) %>%
  gt
```

## Confusion Matrix

This is a matrix that will have "kind of empirical confusion matrix by counting all the
pairs of labels (a, b) that show up together and displaying as a
matrix.  For instance, if three annotators provide labels (1, 1, 2),
then increment count for cells (1, 1), (1, 2), (1,2).  Displaying the
final counts should give you a sense of which categories show up as
well as which have high agreement (high diagonal counts) and which
categories are confusible (high off-diagonal counts)." (Bob's suggestion)

```{r confusion-matrix}
col_range <- function(x) {
  rng <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  (rng[2] - rng[1])
}

df_dup %>%
  select(index, annotator, label) %>%
  group_by(annotator, label) %>%
  count() %>%
  pivot_wider(id_cols = label, names_from = annotator, values_from = n) %>%
  mutate(
    diff = max(elias:vini) - min(elias:vini),
    diff_perc = diff / max(elias:vini)
    ) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  gt
```

## Long format

(annotator-id, item-id, label)

```{r long-format}
df_long <- df %>%
  mutate(index =  rep(1L:1000, 3)) %>%
  group_by(index) %>%
  mutate(label = str_squish(as.character(label))) %>%
  mutate(label = str_split(label, ",")) %>%
  unnest(c(label)) %>%
  ungroup() %>%
  mutate(label = str_squish(label)) %>%
  filter(label != "") %>%
  mutate(label = if_else(label == "999", "99", label)) %>%
  mutate(label = as.factor(label)) %>%
  mutate(
    annotator = case_when(
      annotator == "elias" ~ 1L,
      annotator == "paula" ~ 2L,
      annotator == "vini" ~ 3L,
    TRUE ~ NA_integer_),
    label = case_when(
      label == 0 ~ 1L,
      label == 1 ~ 2L,
      label == 2 ~ 3L,
      label == 3 ~ 4L,
      label == 4 ~ 5L,
      label == 5 ~ 6L,
      label == 6 ~ 7L,
      label == 99 ~ 8L,
      TRUE ~ NA_integer_
    )) %>%
  select(item_id = index, annotator_id = annotator, label_id = label,
         text, user, place, user_place, country, coordinates)

df_long %>%
  write_csv(here::here("pre-labeling", "long_format.csv"))
```

New label formats:

```{r new-labels}
tribble(
                        ~code, ~label,
                        "1", "Unrelated tweet",
            "2", "User currently has symptoms",
          "3", "User had symptoms in the past",
    "4", "Someone else currently has symptoms",
  "5", "Someone else had symptoms in the past",
                      "6", "Conspiracy theory",
  "7", "Someone else has died (death related)",
       "8", "Indonesian, portugal, spanish etc"
  ) %>%
  write_csv(here::here("pre-labeling", "meaning_labels.csv"))
```

## Bob's Confusion Matrix

```{r bob-confmat}
label_df <- df_long %>%
      select(item_id, annotator_id, label_id) %>%
      pivot_wider(id_cols = item_id, names_from = annotator_id, values_from = label_id, values_fn = first) %>%
      arrange(item_id) %>%
      drop_na()
n_labels <- max(length(unique(label_df$`1`)), length(unique(label_df$`2`)), length(unique(label_df$`3`)))

conf_mat <- matrix(0, n_labels, n_labels)

### stuck in coding this

label_df %>% write_csv(here::here("pre-labeling", "pre_confusion_matrix.csv"))
```

## Environment

```{r session-info}
sessionInfo()
